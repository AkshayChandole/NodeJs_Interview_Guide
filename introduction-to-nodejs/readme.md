## What is NodeJS
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side, outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient for building scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it well-suited for handling asynchronous operations like reading/writing files, interacting with databases, and managing network requests, without causing performance bottlenecks.

Some key characteristics of Node.js include:

Single-threaded, event-driven architecture: Node.js uses a single-thread to handle requests but leverages asynchronous I/O and an event loop to manage concurrent operations, allowing it to serve multiple clients without blocking.
NPM (Node Package Manager): Node.js comes with a vast ecosystem of packages and libraries available via NPM, making it easier to build applications with reusable components.
Cross-platform: Node.js is cross-platform, meaning it runs on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Use cases: It's commonly used for building REST APIs, real-time applications (like chat apps), microservices, and server-side applications.
