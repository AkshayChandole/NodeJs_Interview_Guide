## What is NodeJS?(#what-is-nodejs)
Node.js is a **_runtime environment_** that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side, outside of a web browser. It is built on **_Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine_**, which makes it fast and efficient for building scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js uses an **_event-driven, non-blocking I/O model_**, which makes it well-suited for handling asynchronous operations like reading/writing files, interacting with databases, and managing network requests, without causing performance bottlenecks.

Some key characteristics of Node.js include:

1. **Single-threaded, event-driven architecture:** Node.js uses a single-thread to handle requests but leverages asynchronous I/O and an event loop to manage concurrent operations, allowing it to serve multiple clients without blocking.
2. **NPM (Node Package Manager):** Node.js comes with a vast ecosystem of packages and libraries available via NPM, making it easier to build applications with reusable components.
3. **Cross-platform:** Node.js is cross-platform, meaning it runs on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

**Use cases:** It's commonly used for building REST APIs, real-time applications (like chat apps), microservices, and server-side applications.
